This file is dedicated for implementing the [Deep Fashion Analysis with Feature Map Upsampling and Landmark-driven Attention](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dyj0JIziIrTRWMWDfPOapksnJM5iPzEi/view)model in a non-GPU machine.

Compare to the source code in [fdjingyuan's](https://github.com/fdjingyuan/Deep-Fashion-Analysis-ECCV2018) github, the /src/network.py is modified to only keep forward method in the network class, the batch size will be changed to one. To skip the process for configure  /src/const.py with /src/conf/whole.py, I copied everthing in /src/conf/whole.py to /src/const.py.

## Demo for how to use it

### 1. Import 

```
import pandas as pd


from Model_loading import Label_Fashion_Image

```

### 2. Suppose all the image you want do classfication are in the following directory:

```

directory='/Users/zhang.xiaoya/Desktop/photos/'

```


### 3. Initiate an instance of the classification model:

```
p=Label_Fashion_Image()

```

### 4. Label all the image 

```

all_=p.all_img(directory)


all_.to_csv('result.csv')

```


### 5. In case you want do classification for single image,  there is no need to initiate another instance, just use the previous one:

```
file='q.jpg'

single_=p.single_img('q.jpg')

```
